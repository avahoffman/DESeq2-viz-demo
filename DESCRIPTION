Description: 
    This workspace will demonstrate how to visualize RNA-seq results. Data comes 
    from an RNA-seq study of *Arabidopsis* samples collected under different 
    conditions (e.g., dehydration, ABA). Here, we analyze RNA differences in 
    using `DESeq2`, an R package for differential gene expression. The notebooks 
    included in this workspace show example visualizations for comparing RNA-seq 
    samples. This workspace expands on the work by Kayla Interdonato and Martin 
    Morgan in [This workspace](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/bioconductor-rpci-anvil/Bioconductor-Workflow-DESeq2)
